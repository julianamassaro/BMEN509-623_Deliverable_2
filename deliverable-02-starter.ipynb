    "- **X-ray Tube Physics:** X-rays are produced when high-speed electrons strike a metal target (anode), resulting in rapid deceleration (bremsstrahlung) and ejection of inner-shell electrons (characteristic X-rays). The output spectrum is a combination of continuous (bremsstrahlung) and discrete (characteristic) peaks.\n",
    "- **Tube Voltage (kVp):** Sets the maximum photon energy; higher kVp increases beam penetration but reduces contrast.\n",
    "- **Tube Current (mA):** Controls the number of electrons (and thus photons) produced per second; affects image brightness and patient dose.\n",
    "- **Filtration:** Removes low-energy photons (which contribute to dose but not image quality), resulting in a \"harder\" (higher average energy) spectrum. The filtered spectrum $I(E)$ is zero for $E < E_{filter}$.\n",
